## ✨ Overview

**Enhanced Gesture-Based Authentication** is a novel, secure, and dynamic two-factor authentication (2FA) system that replaces traditional fingerprint authentication with **gesture-based recognition**. Designed for applications requiring robust access control, the system combines **motion detection**, **facial verification**, and **hand gesture validation**, offering resistance against spoofing and replay attacks.

This repository contains the codebase, model implementations, and documentation to reproduce and extend the results from the paper:

## 🔐 Key Features

- 🚶 Motion-triggered activation
- 🧍‍♂️ Single-person detection using YOLOv8
- 🙂 Face verification using ArcFace + RetinaFace
- ✋ Real-time gesture recognition with MediaPipe
- 🔐 Dummy gesture injection for enhanced security
- 🔁 Anti-repetition filter to avoid reuse of sequences
- ✅ Transformer-based gesture validation module

## 🧠 System Architecture

The core components of the **SecureGestureNet++** framework include:

1. **Motion Trigger Unit (MTU)** – Detects motion before activating authentication.
2. **Identity Assurance Layer (IAL)** – Detects presence of one individual and verifies identity.
3. **Gesture Validation Module (GVM)** – Uses temporal keypoints and a transformer to verify gestures.
4. **Anti-Repetition Dummy Filter (ARDF)** – Ensures novelty in authentication sequences.

## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Motion Detection**: The camera remains idle until motion is detected.
2. **Person Identification**: System activates only if one person is in the frame.
3. **Face Verification**: Face is matched using ArcFace to confirm identity.
4. **Gesture Authentication**:

   * User performs gestures (e.g., A, C, D, E).
   * Dummy gestures like X, Y, Z can be inserted.
   * Transformer evaluates gesture confidence.
   * Anti-repetition logic ensures gestures aren’t reused.

## 🧬 Example Gesture Sequence

```text
Stored:       A, C, D, E
Attempted:    A, X, C, Y, D, Z, E   ✅ (Valid with dummy gestures)
```
